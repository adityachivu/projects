Deep learning provides a very powerful framework to perform supervised learning. Adding more layers and more units within a layer, a deep network can represent functions of great complexity. It is proven that Neural Networks are Universal function approximators. Therefore with networks of sufficient size and with data and computational power to match, tasks that consist of mapping an input vector to an output vector, and that are easy for a person to do rapidly, can be accomplished via deep learning, given labeled training examples.

\section*{History}
Neural Networks, as the name suggest was inspired by modeling of the brain functions. The earliest ancestor of these networks was the \textit{multi-layer perceptron}. It represented a linear classifier that had individual perceptrons firing to indicate location of the test point on the higher-dimension space decision boundary.
